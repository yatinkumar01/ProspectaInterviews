Question :  Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

This can be represented in an excel sheet below:

A B C

1 5 3 =5+A1

2 7 8 =A2+B2

3 9 =4+5 =C2+B3

I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output
with the results. If it is a value, then return a value. If it is a formula then
 calculate the formula and return the value of that formula



 Question 1 :  How will you tackle the challenge above?

 Ans :   For solving this task I will follow these steps:

 step1 :  First, I will create a file with name csv.file in my current directory and put this information
          inside that in a single line like written on the above.

          BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("csv.file");



 step2 :  Now, With the help of BufferedReader class object, I will read my data by using readLine() method.

          String data = bufferedReader.readLine();


 step3 : after that I will convert this whole string in Array of String using split method.

         String[] keys = data.split(",");


 step4 : then, I will create a map and store it in the form of key-value pairs using loop and split method.

 		 Map<String,String> map1 = new LinkedHashMap<>();

 		 Map<String,Integer> map1 = new LinkedHashMap<>();

 		 for(int i=0;i<key.length();i++){

 		 String[] temp = keys[i].split(":");
 		 map.put(temp[0].trim(),temp[1].trim());
 		 }

 step5 : After that I will create One more Map for converting those strings values in the form of Integer value.
         With the help of running a loop on first map I will check that there is simple Integer value or any
         function is there.
         If there will be any function then solve it and after that put the final Integer value for that key in
         the second map.


step 6 : And at the end, I will loop the map using entry and show the result in form of new key-value pairs.

As for error handling, some of the errors that I would check for include:

Invalid CSV file format: I would check if the input CSV file is properly formatted and contains the correct number of columns and rows.
Invalid formula: I would check if the formula contains valid operands and operators, and handle any errors that arise from attempting to evaluate an invalid formula.
Invalid input values: I would check if the input values are of the correct type and within the valid range of values.
Invalid output values: I would check if the calculated output values are of the correct type and within the valid range of values.
To prevent a user from breaking the code, I would include input validation checks and error handling to handle any unexpected input values or formulas. Additionally, I would write unit tests to validate the program's functionality and catch any errors before the program is deployed.


Question 2 :  What type of errors you would you check for?

Ans : There might be few types of error like-

      1. In reading data with bufferReader and converting it into proper strings.
         For solving that I tried to use split and trim methods.

      2. In finding that it is normal Integer value of function of string which key here.
         For solving that I will use Regular Expressions to match it and finding if there will
         be any Integer value without connected with any Character(A-Z) at the front of that.

      3. And one more thing we need to care about = , : and + sign as well.


 Question 3 : How might a user break your code?

 Ans : User can break my code by doing some changes inside CSV file. Like if user will change the format of input
       of input then this code will not work and if user will value of numbers which more than the Max value of
       Integer then also it will not work properly.
